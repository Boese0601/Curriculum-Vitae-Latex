	\textit{My current research direction mainly focuses on how to improve the existing multi-stage object detection algorithm and single / multi-target tracking algorithm, and the understanding and practical application of semantic segmentation algorithm. Read the papers on segmentation, detection and tracking recommended by the tutor, and report on the algorithms in the recent papers in the weekly group meeting.
		We also applied the mature detection algorithm and made improvements, participated in the competition organized by kaggle or other units such as whale community, and achieved excellent ranking and results. Also we evaluate the application value and practicability of the algorithm by reproducing the algorithm proposed by the laboratory and applying it to the actual industrial scene.

			\item Using CascadeRCNN+ResNext101+FPN as the basic framework
			\item Applying Mosaic,RandomRotate90°,etc. data augumentation technology to reduce network overfitting and improve model
			generalization ability

			\item Using multi-scale training and prediction to adapt to the difference in picture resolution which make the target size
			distribution involved in training more balanced, making the model more robust to the target size
			\item Implementing soft-nms,Cutout to enhance the detection rate of targets that are only half covered by rocks or overlap with each other
			\item Using the Deformable Convolutional Network instead of the common CNN operation increases the model complexity and computational complexity, but significantly improves the recognition accuracy

		Aim: Realize UAV flying with the target vehicle and emergency response for pedestrians and other conditions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Platform: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX/NVIDIA Jetson TX2
			\item Algorithm Framework: YoloV5 Detection+JDE Multi-Object-Tracking(CVPR 2020)
			\item Step1: Output the xy coordinates of the center point of the object. The data is stable without big fluctuation and out of frame.
			The UAV sends the current euler Angle data of the UAV to the vision module.\\
			Step2:The vision module combines the height data and Euler Angle calculated, and then sends the distance error in the XY
			direction to the UAV.\\
			Step 3:The UAV provides euler Angle information, and the visual module serves as the control center and directly sends the
			expected velocity data of the four axes.
